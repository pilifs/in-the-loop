"""Copies a stream's run records into the default workspace, the only one that publishes them.

feature-loop.sh writes a record of each run in llm-dlc/loop-summaries/ of the workspace it runs in
(gitignored), and sync.py publishes, redacted, only the default workspace's. A stream's records
are its own workspace's, so run-streams.sh copies them in after each of the stream's runs and
before the merge, whose commit publishes them. A record only grows, so a copy is replaced only by
the record it is a start of; one that is not (edited, or another run's of the same name) is left,
and reported. Files there that are not run records, such as integration reports, are not copied.

Usage: python3 llm-dlc/tools/run_records.py collect STREAM_WORKSPACE DEFAULT_WORKSPACE
